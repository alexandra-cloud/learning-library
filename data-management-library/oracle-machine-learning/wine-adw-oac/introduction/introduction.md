### About Product/Technology

**Oracle Machine Learning** extends Oracle Database and enables users to build “AI” applications and analytical dashboards. OML delivers powerful in-database machine learning algorithms, automated ML functionality via SQL APIs and integration with open source Python and R.

To select a good inexpensive wine, you will:
- Use the Oracle Machine Learning Notebook to:
    - Understand the Business Problem
    - Explore Data
    - Identify Key Attributes
    - Build and Test Predictive Machine Learning Models
    - Apply Machine Learning Models for Predictions
- Further investigate insights and predictions using Oracle Analytics Cloud, Interactive analytics, charts and more.

### Workshop Scenario

Let's take a scenario where we are invited to a party and want to bring something to contribute. A bottle of wine is always a good option. But which one? There are so many! And we don't want to break the bank for our party gift. Let's try to use the Autonomous Database, Oracle Machine Learning and Oracle Analytics Cloud to find a likely tasty and likely to be rated greater than 90 Points (GT\_90\_Points) adult beverage that is also affordable (Under $30).

Note:  Data comes from Kaggle WineReviews130K data = 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, etc. Points was binned to GT\_90\_Points and LT\_90\_Points  [https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)

Using Wine Reviews data from Kaggle, we build, evaluate and apply Oracle Machine Learning models using random forests and support vector machine classification techniques that identify likely good (GT\_90\_Points) bottles of wine. This demo highlights OML's text mining capabilities and its tight integration with Oracle Analytics Cloud for interactively explore OML's insights and predictions.
